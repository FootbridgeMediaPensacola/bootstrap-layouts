# Bootstrap Components and Blank Layout

This is the home of Footbridge Media's layout components. In the components folder you will find multiple layout folders which serve as different pieces of layout templates.


## Layout Creation Guide

1. Copy the `blank-layout` folder to the directory of your choosing to start.
1. In the `components` folder, you should see all of the necessary HTML and SCSS to start assembling your layout. 
1. The HTML contents should be pasted directly into your new layout folder's `index.html` file. 
1. The SCSS stylesheet should be added to your `styles` folder.
1. After adding the component's stylesheet, you need to include it in your `theme.scss` file. It should be under the comment that says `Custom Styles`.
